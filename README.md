# Brush as WebAssembly Module!
An experiment to use WebAssembly module as brush file. The purpose is to embed the bush together with project file so that vector layers in projects can be rendered correctly across multiple devices while taking little amount of storage space.

## Try it out
> [!TIP]
> For best experience, use a graphics tablet or a device with pressure-sensitive stylus support!

Open [this page](https://nahkd123.github.io/brush-as-webassembly-module) in your favorite browser. Chromium is recommended to ensure the pointer event feature working correctly (though most modern browsers should support pointer events API already).

## What's next?
- Embed brush preset inside WebAssembly module maybe?

    <h1>Brush as WebAssembly Module</h1>
    <p>
        An experiment of storing brush engine as WebAssembly module. For a simple brush, it is quite small (about 250 
        bytes in size). My plan is to store brush settings under custom section as well, but I'm not sure if it is
        possible to "fork" the module without writing WASM binary parser.</p>
    <p>
        Alternatively, I can just store only the settings in a JSON file, which is much easier and takes less disk
        space.
